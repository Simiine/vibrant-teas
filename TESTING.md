# Validation
## HTML
- Testing was carried out using Jigsaw - https://validator.w3.org/ 
- All pages passed except for the Product Management Page and the Shopping Bag.
- Product Management Page: The error said there was a duplicate ID image coming from the Django form, so I wasn't able to remove it.

- The Shopping bag had an error of duplicate ID. The main reason for this duplicate ID was because the include file for the quantty form has to appear twice in the DOM because it has a mobile view and larger screen view.

## PEP8

# Manual Testing
To ensure cross-compatibility, I tested the website across numerous devices and web browsers. The site was tested across different iPhones, a Samsung, an iPad, a Mac laptop, and a Lenovo laptop. The site was also tested across Google Chrome and Safari. For responsiveness, I used the developer tool for screen adjustments, so I could see how the site would look on different screen sizes as I made the required adjustments for it to be completely responsive.
