# Manual Testing
To ensure cross-compatibility, I tested the website across numerous devices and web browsers. The site was tested across different iPhones, a Samsung, an iPad, a Mac laptop, and a Lenovo laptop. The site was also tested across Google Chrome and Safari. For responsiveness, I used the developer tool for screen adjustments, so I could see how the site would look on different screen sizes as I made the required adjustments for it to be completely responsive.
